1,"As long as it is above cost basis, that person or firm is about to book like a 300% gain on shares.

Even if the gains are capped, 300% is not exactly a bad return on capital."
2,There‚Äôs a special place in hell for people who hurt cats

Electric bus battery market will be globally larger than electric car battery market .

Airbnb priced the range for a pop. They‚Äôre not dumb. They literally waited almost an extra decade to IPO to figure these details out. But sure your wonderful analysis shows the price range is perfectly calibrated and won‚Äôt be raised like the last twenty big IPOs

What kind of investment banker is this clueless about one of the years most important IPOs?"
18,Buy the 700c 12/14?

31,"""We will do all in our power to ensure that Warner does not do so at our expense. We will aggressively pursue economic terms that preserve our business.""

Sure sounds like AMC is going to demand that Warner compensate them for not showing movies in their theaters. So that would be AMC's only other form of leverage. Not that it would play out well at all. Should be interesting, though."
32,"Right, time to back the truck up. Only 37c a share..."

37,Monday gonna be big green
38,True. I haven't looked at the numbers lately but I have to assume the debt and pension obligations are manageable? Additionally picking up the workforce almost guarantees that your company is TBTF and will receive government handouts into perpetutiy....just as we enter a 10 year period where its expected that the government's around the world are prepared to break open the bank and spend to infinity.
39,"You have $700 left, what do you mean you can't get it back."
40,"Bought cheap OTM calls (2-4 months exps) on SRTY for this exact reason. If the position goes to zero, who cares because it's a cheap insurance policy for my portfolio. If shit hits the fan, the Russell will tank hard and the 3x leveraged timebomb that is SRTY will explode upwards."

47,Don't you see? The stock market is a tool made by the rich to make them richer. The only reason it ever crashes is to scare poor/middle class people out of investing. Just buy leaps on good companies and you'll bank
48,Cuz retart
49,I need all the confirmation bias I can get. I‚Äôm going to check it right now.

59,"Just remember that there is massive survivor bias in here. For every one of OP or other people who are swinging massive gains, there are hundreds of thousands of people who lose.

EDIT: In a football stadium full of 80,000 people, you would have to be the one person in there with the winning hand."
60,"When I lived in Philly I did this. No one wanted to rent to me because of bad credit at the time. Paid my entire year in advance, no more issues. Nice not having to worry about it too"

67,"Each currency has a pair. For example, the US Dollar can pair with the Euro to make a EURUSD. This is called a currency pair. Basically, it‚Äôs how much one currency costs using another currency. So if the EURUSD is trading at say $1.2505, then you can buy 1 Euro for the cost of $1.2505 Us Dollars. The goal is to either buy the Euro with hopes that the price will increase so you can sell at a profit, or sell the Euro with hopes that the price will decrease so you can buy it back at a lower price for a profit. Much like Calls and Puts. 

Forex is risky because of the leverage and volatility. People often blow their accounts because they use too much leverage, improper lot sizes (how many units of currency), underestimate the volatility, and don‚Äôt use proper risk/reward ratios. a 50pip SL should have a 150pip TP. 

It takes a long time to understand the markets fully and each currency pair trades different, much like how TSLA trades differently than GME or SPY. 

Hope this helps.

u/oben_yalfan Sorry I commented on the wrong post. Hope this helps"
68,I want to know why I was given a 7 instead of 3 day ban for obviously ironically suggesting pumping a small cap. Pretty brutal. Got covid like two days before and spent those seven days coughing through the bars reading WSB daily thread alone in my home.

But it was either late 2018 or 2019 but I was thinking about putting 1k or 2k buying the latest possible calls at the highest possible strike price. Would i be a millionaire if I would of done it and held through now.
