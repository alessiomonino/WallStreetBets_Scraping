SP,2,"Guess you never heard of SPG, which has rocketed to the International space station.,Each currency has a pair. For example, the US Dollar can pair with the Euro to make a EURUSD. This is called a currency pair. Basically, itâ€™s how much one currency costs using another currency. So if the EURUSD is trading at say $1.2505, then you can buy 1 Euro for the cost of $1.2505 Us Dollars. The goal is to either buy the Euro with hopes that the price will increase so you can sell at a profit, or sell the Euro with hopes that the price will decrease so you can buy it back at a lower price for a profit. Much like Calls and Puts. 

Forex is risky because of the leverage and volatility. People often blow their accounts because they use too much leverage, improper lot sizes (how many units of currency), underestimate the volatility, and donâ€™t use proper risk/reward ratios. a 50pip SL should have a 150pip TP. 

It takes a long time to understand the markets fully and each currency pair trades different, much like how TSLA trades differently than GME or SPY. 

Hope this helps.

EDIT,1,"Just remember that there is massive survivor bias in here. For every one of OP or other people who are swinging massive gains, there are hundreds of thousands of people who lose.

EDIT: In a football stadium full of 80,000 people, you would have to be the one person in there with the winning hand."
